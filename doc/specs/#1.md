## :dart: Requirements

### :spiral_notepad: Description

I want to write a small program to learn something about blockchain technology. My idea was to save data defining a status of a software deployment in a blockchain. 

> [!NOTE]
> I would not recommend to use this in production but as a learning project it is fine. There are exisiting solutions like [sigstore/rekor: Software Supply Chain Transparency Log](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor) which do similar things. But I want to implement it on my own to learn something about blockchains. 

The data I want to save are:
- Name of the software
- Version number
- Timestamp of deployment
- Commit hash
- Url to repository
- Author like name of company
- Contact information like email
- Merkle root of the deployed files

The name, the version number and the timestamp are metainformation about the deployment. It just improves the readability and helps the user to identify what version he has.
The commit hash and the url to the repository allow to identify the source code of the deployment. By inspecting the commit a signing with GPG might give further trust to the code. For example, it shows that GitHub knows the identity of the author who pushed the code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will develop this project with Git and GitHub in mind. Other version control systems and repository hosting services are out of scope for now but the data model should be designed in a way that it can be extended later.

The author and contact information allow to identify who did the deployment. It is just for transparency. 

The merkle root allows to verify the integrity of the deployed files. It is a hash value calculated from all files of the deployment. By comparing the merkle root stored in the blockchain with a merkle root calculated from the deployed files, it is possible to verify that no file has been changed after the deployment.

This builds a chain of trust from the author who did the deployment to the source code and the deployed files. Transparently stored in a blockchain to prevent manipulation. Users can verify the integrity of the deployed files by themselves.

This builds a chain of trust like this:

```mermaid
    block
    Author<["Author"]>(right)
    GpgSignature<["GPG Signature"]>(right)
    Commit<["Commit"]>(right)
    Repo<["Repository"]>(right)
    Build<["Build"]>(right)
    MerkleRoot<["Merkle Root"]>(right)
    Blockchain>"Blockchain"]
```

The program should allow to add new deployment records to the blockchain and sign them with a key as a developer and to verify existing records by users.

### :question: Open Questions?
1. @Who: What must be discussed?

### :construction: Blockers

1. Something blocks my work.

### :inbox_tray: Input
- Name of the software
- Version number
- Timestamp of deployment
- Commit hash
- Url to repository
- Author like name of company
- Contact information like email

### :outbox_tray: Output

- Merkle root of the deployed files
- A block in the blockchain containing the deployment record.

### :control_knobs: Conditions

The blockchain must be cheap and fast to use. Therefore I will try to use Solana as blockchain platform.

### :warning: Side effects

Are there any?

## :heavy_check_mark: Acceptance tests
- [ ] I will check that all needed data is stored in the blockchain.
- [ ] I will check the chain of trust by checking the signature of the author in GitHub. Than in the blockchain the project url and commit hash. Finally the merkle root of the deployed files. Lastly I will check the signature of the deployment record with the public key of the developer.

## :triangular_ruler: Design

I will write a cli app in Python because it is also a Python workshop. The app should be able to automate all steps developers or users have to do. Those are adding a new deployment record to a blockchain. The new block should be broadcasted to other nodes in the network. Users should be able to verify existing deployment records by checking the signatures and the merkle root.

The app needs to have functions to create a merkle root from a set of files. A deployment is always a set of files. It might be a set of binaries or an installer or just source code. The deployment must be organized in a folder. This folder is the input for the merkle root calculation. The directory is scanned for files and all files are listed as the method `.rglob("*")` from `pathlib` returns them. `.gitignore` files are honored. The folder `.git` and exactly those files ignored by git are not considered for the merkle root calculation. The files are hashed with SHA256. The hashes are combined pairwise and hashed again until only one hash remains. This is the merkle root.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start@{ shape: sm-circ, label: "Small start" } --> Folder[/"Folder with files"/]
    Folder --> GetFile["Get file in folder"]
    subgraph listFiles["List files"]
    GetFile --> IsIgnored{Ignore?}
    IsIgnored -- Yes --> GetFile
    IsIgnored -- No --> AddFileToList["Add file to list"]
    end
    listFiles --> FilesToHash("Files to hash")
    FilesToHash --> HashFile["Hash file with SHA256"]
    HashFile --> Hashes("List of hashes")
    Hashes --> ComputeMerkleRoot("Compute merkle root")
    ComputeMerkleRoot --> MerkleRoot["Merkle root"]
    MerkleRoot --> End@{ shape: framed-circle, label: "Stop" }
```

It needs to have functions to create and verify signatures with asymmetric cryptography. That means developers need to create a key pair. The private key is used to sign deployment records. The public key is used by users to verify the signatures. In a first step I will try to use Solana as blockchain platform. It has cheap and fast transactions, which is good for the task. There are libraries for Python to interact with Solana.

[kevinheavey/solders: A high-performance Python toolkit for Solana, written in Rust](https://github.com/kevinheavey/solders)

[michaelhly/solana-py: Solana Python SDK](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py)

I will generate the key pair with an mnemonic seed phrase. The libraries have functions to create key pairs from a seed phrase. This way a user can store the seed phrase on a safe offline medium and recreate the key pair when needed.

Solana uses the Ed25519 algorithm for signing and verifying signatures and uses a Base58 encoding for the public key as the address. The public key is also the address of an account on Solana. This is much simpler than other blockchains do it but state of the art and safe.

The app prompts the user to enter the data interactively.

The data is:

- Name of the software
- Version number
- Timestamp of deployment
- Commit hash
- Url to repository
- Author like name of company
- Contact information like email
- Merkle root of the deployed files

    <summary>PR</summary>

A PR needs a title that lets the reviewer recognize which ticket it belongs to. The format is:

`#<issue number> <issue title>`

It helps the reviewer if you provide details about the development environment. Breaking changes in services can make it unclear which versions of services the reviewer should use for the review.

The versions can be set up from artefacts or via Git by using the correct branches.

If the exact version is not critical, it may be sufficient to simply use the image with latest.

Here is a template for a PR:

```markdown
## Notes

BREAKING CHANGE: Is this a breaking change?

Is there anything special to note? Perhaps deviations from the ticket or details that came up during development?

## Changes

- Fixed a typo
- Optimized code
- New feature XYZ

## Development environment

### Versions

| Application | Version |
| :---------- | ------: |
| Client      |   1.5.0 |
| Service     |   1.2.4 |
| KeyCloak    |  latest |
| Postgres    |  latest |

### Setup

Scripts or test data used? Ideally attach or link it.
```
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Database migration with EF Core</summary>

```powershell
PS> cd .\src\ProjectName
PS> dotnet ef database update
PS> dotnet ef migrations add <migration_name> --project ..\ProjectName.csproj
```

`dotnet ef` can be updated with the command `dotnet tool update -g dotnet-ef --version 7.0.14`.

During development, sometimes it is necessary to recreate a migration:

```powershell
# List all migrations an copy the one to reset the database to.
dotnet ef migrations list

dotnet ef database update <migration_name> && dotnet ef migrations remove && dotnet ef migrations add <migration_name> --project ..\ProjectName.csproj && dotnet ef database update
```

> [!WARNING] ATTENTION
> Before merging into `main`, you must check if there are new migrations. The best way to do this is by comparing the migrations in `main` with those in your own branch. It is a good idea to commit migrations separately so that they can be easily reverted if necessary.

If there are new migrations on `main`, proceed as follows:

1. With the feature branch, reset the database to the last state before your own migration. `dotnet ef database update <migration_name>`
2. On the feature branch, remove the last commit with a `reset`.
3. Merge `main`.
4. Now create a new migration. `dotnet ef migrations add <migration_name> --project ..\ProjectName.csproj && dotnet ef database update`
5. Commit the migration.

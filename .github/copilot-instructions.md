# Copilot Instructions (Python)

## General
- Prefer small, readable functions and clear naming.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the request.

## Project Structure
- Source code lives in the `src/` directory.
- Tests live in the `tests/` directory.

## Testing
- Use `pytest` as the test framework.
- Name tests `test_*.py` and test functions `test_*`.

## Style
- Prefer explicit imports and avoid wildcard imports.
- Add brief comments only when the intent is not obvious.
- Functions and methods should have docstrings as documentation.
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types.
